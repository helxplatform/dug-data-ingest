# Since Dug Data Ingest contains many different types of files, it is valuable to check it with several linters to
# make sure that all the different files are as clean and readable as possible.
#
# To reduce developer aggravation:
# - This GitHub action won't try to fix anything -- that's up to you, if you want to do it.
# - This GitHub action will only run on PRs.
#
# You can adjust the behavior by modifying this file.
